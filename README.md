# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project aims to predict customer churn in a business using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting and preventing churn is crucial for maintaining a healthy customer base.

In this project, we have used TensorFlow and Keras to build a binary classification model. The model predicts whether a customer will churn (1) or not (0) based on various features. We have achieved an accuracy of 85.65% on the test dataset using the ReLU activation function and the Adam optimizer. Additionally, we have performed a binary cross-entropy loss to evaluate the model's performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadyasingh55/CustomerChurnPredusingANN/edit/main/notebook8ad570467f.ipynb
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

Here's how to use the model for customer churn prediction:

1. Load your dataset with customer information.
2. Preprocess the data, ensuring it matches the format used during training.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Performance

- Accuracy: 85.65%
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy

These metrics indicate the model's ability to predict customer churn accurately.
